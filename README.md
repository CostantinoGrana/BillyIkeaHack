# A slope ceiling hack of Ikea Billy
So, I have this attic with a sloping ceiling and I want to put a bookcase in it, to free some space in the living room:

Billy is cheap and nice, well known and easy to hack. The lower side is about 150 cm, while the higher one can nearly house a full Billy. Now the choice is if I have to go with a stair case look, or a sloped one. Unfortunately, differently from Platza, the Billy bookcase is not modular at all. The lower module doesn't even support the extension block. So, I'll go for the hacking way to get a sloped Billy library.

I'm not very good at carpentry, so I'm not going to have a sloped top, just two sides with different heights. Here is the result with the first module:

Here is the second one:

Now, let's see how I did it. First of all, don't make my mistake: after completing one module, don't cut the upright by measuring it, but put the two corresponding uprights side by side and mark the cutting line that way. Otherwise you will get two sides with one or two millimetres difference and fixing that is a nightmare.
Here you can see the already cut uproghts:

Cutting the uprights was not so difficult even using my 40 years old Black and Decker jigsaw, an alluminium bar, a couple of F-clamps (with off-cuts wood buffers) and masking tape. The result is **good enough, but far from perfect** because I should have used a blade with smaller teeth, worked with a slower speed and removed the masking tape with more care:

Anyway, I'm quite happy of the result and there's no obvious visible damage. Remember that when cutting with the jigsaw (at least with by blades) the side on top will be ok, while the bottom side will get the previous cracks.

Let's move to the assembling:

Whops! We removed the area where the top shelf was supposed to be attached. I tried to just ignore it, but the result wasn't stable enough, so we really need to provide a fixed top shel
