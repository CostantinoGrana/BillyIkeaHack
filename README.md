# A slope ceiling hack of Ikea Billy
So, I have this attic with a sloping ceiling and I want to put a bookcase in it, to free some space in the living room:

Billy is cheap and nice, well known and easy to hack. The lower side is about 150 cm, while the higher one can nearly house a full Billy. Now the choice is if I have to go with a stair case look, or a sloped one. Unfortunately, differently from Platza, the Billy bookcase is not modular at all. The lower module doesn't even support the extension block. So, I'll go for the hacking way to get a sloped Billy library.

I'm not very good at carpentry, so I'm not going to have a sloped top, just two sides with different heights. Here is the result with the first module:

Here is the second one:

Now, let's see how I did it. First of all, don't make my mistake: after completing one module, don't cut the upright by measuring it, but put the two corresponding uprights side by side and mark the cutting line that way. Otherwise you will get two sides with one or two millimetres difference and fixing that is a nightmare.
Here you can see the already cut uproghts:

Cutting the uprights was not so difficult even using my 40 years old Black and Decker jigsaw, an alluminium bar, a couple of F-clamps (with off-cuts wood buffers) and masking tape. The result is **good enough, but far from perfect** because I should have used a blade with smaller teeth, worked with a slower speed and removed the masking tape with more care:

![Hard to see adhesive tape marks](https://github.com/CostantinoGrana/BillyIkeaHack/raw/main/Ikea/IMG_20201205_130601.jpg)
Anyway, I'm quite happy of the result and there's no obvious visible damage. Remember that when cutting with the jigsaw (at least with by blades) the side on top will be ok, while the bottom side will get the previous cracks.

Let's move to the assembling:
![Assembling](https://github.com/CostantinoGrana/BillyIkeaHack/raw/main/Ikea/IMG_20201205_130628.jpg)

Whops! We removed the area where the top shelf was supposed to be attached. I tried to just ignore it, but the result wasn't stable enough, so we really need to provide a side-fixed top shelf. So I took the removed top part of the upright and made a reference out of it:
![Drilling positions](https://github.com/CostantinoGrana/BillyIkeaHack/raw/main/Ikea/IMG_20201205_131107.jpg)

I marked the drilling positions with a awl:
![Awl marking of drilling positions](https://github.com/CostantinoGrana/BillyIkeaHack/raw/main/Ikea/IMG_20201205_131249.jpg)

Then I made the holes with a 4 mm and a 8 mm drill bit. Be careful, because the centering tip goes further than the side and you must be careful to not drill all the way through the upright. Maybe you can find blind hole drilling bits, but I only have one for hinges which is obviously too large.

![4 mm holes](https://github.com/CostantinoGrana/BillyIkeaHack/raw/main/Ikea/IMG_20201205_132108.jpg)
Than you can go on with the usual Billy assembly:

![Put everything together](https://github.com/CostantinoGrana/BillyIkeaHack/raw/main/Ikea/IMG_20201205_133700.jpg)

Then you need the last hacking of the back panel, in order to have the sloping back: measure the top position at each side, draw a line and cut with a cutter. But...

**Don't do as I show in this picture!!!** In fact on the last Billy I realized that, instead, I should have cut with the **white side on top**. As for the jigsaw, the cutter ruins the bottom side and is nicer on the top one. Anyway, it's not anything dramatic. It still works:

![Fourth module](https://github.com/CostantinoGrana/BillyIkeaHack/raw/main/Ikea/IMG_20201205_195030.jpg)

A big problem was how to fix the columns to the wall so that they aligned correctly. I had previously used a Platsa and many fixing washers were left with their corresponding plastic covers, so I used two for each column:
![Platsa fixing technique](https://github.com/CostantinoGrana/BillyIkeaHack/raw/main/Ikea/IMG_20201205_195108.jpg)

And what about the lower part? Well I should have screwed the columns together, but then I thought that along with my previous Platsa installation I also got some spare metal joiners which looked promising. Well, they fit two Billy uprights perfectly and also give it a nice look:

The final result is this:

All in all, I'm pretty happy with the result, which looks good and fits perfectly under the sloped roof. I'm now thinking of extending it further over the radiator, and I'm sure I've seen an Ikea hack for this, but I can't find it anymore. I'll update this
