# A slope ceiling hack of Ikea Billy
So, I have this attic with a sloping ceiling and I want to put a bookcase in it, to free some space in the living room:

Billy is cheap and nice, well known and easy to hack. The lower side is about 150 cm, while the higher one can nearly house a full Billy. Now the choice is if I have to go with a stair case look, or a sloped one. Unfortunately, differently from Platza, the Billy bookcase is not modular at all. The lower module doesn't even support the extension block. So, I'll go for the hacking way to get a sloped Billy library.
